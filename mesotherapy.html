										<p>Every day our skin is affected in many ways: unbalanced diet, stress, as well as wind and weather. Cosmetics are then often no longer sufficient to protect and care for the skin adequately.</p>

										<p>Here, mesotherapy for face and body is one of the most effective ways to regenerate, tighten and revitalize the skin. This is done by injecting a special amino acid cocktail with additional hyaluronic acid.									
									</p>
									<p>The skin is hydrated and regains its freshness.</p>

										<p>The treatment takes place on an outpatient basis and lasts between a few minutes and half an hour, depending on what is needed.For the treatment, the mixture of active ingredients to be injected is put together individually and freshly prepared.The drugs and active ingredients are injected into the skin directly in the area to be treated. The needles (cannulas) used are extremely thin and have a special cut. Both make the injection almost painless. In addition, the mixture of active ingredients always contains a light anesthetic. It is applied either manually or with a so-called mesotherapy gun. This allows, among other things, the treatment of larger areas in a short time and precise and economical dosing. The injection technique varies depending on which area is being treated: in some treatments, the surface of the skin is only gently stroked, in other cases deeper infiltrations into the fatty connective tissue are necessary.</p>

										<p>After the treatment, the affected areas are cooled and a special protective cream is applied. As a rule, the treatment leaves no traces, so that you can immediately go about your everyday life again. Depending on the indication, the treatment is usually carried out several times at intervals of one week to several months. Three to five treatments are often sufficient to achieve long-term success.
										In trained hands and if all precautionary measures are observed, side effects are rarely observed. Reddening of the skin and swelling are particularly possible if sensitive areas of the skin are treated, for example around the eyes and lips. Rarely, there are vegetative reactions such as dizziness and nausea. More severe side effects such as growth scars or connective tissue nodules (granulomas) are extremely rare. What is typical, however, is what is known as an initial reaction, which can show up as reddening, skin peeling, swelling and possibly slight pain. This is a phenomenon that is often observed in naturopathy and indicates the beginning of the body's cleansing and repair processes. These symptoms are fully reversible and usually short-lived.</p>
