							<p>Depending on the type and extent of the threads used, the lifting effect lasts 1 to 2 years. The threads are already broken down by the body after approx. 12 - 18 months, but the increased collagen formation creates a natural support structure at the same time.</p>

							<p>The thread lift is a minimally invasive, proven procedure for restoring the natural contours of the face â€“ without a scalpel.</p>
							<p>Thread lifts are mostly used in the lower and upper face area and of course also on the neck.</p>

Three to five treatments are often sufficient to achieve long-term success.
								In trained hands and if all precautionary measures are observed, side effects are rarely observed. Reddening of the skin and swelling are particularly possible if sensitive areas of the skin are treated, for example around the eyes and lips. Rarely, there are vegetative reactions such as dizziness and nausea. More severe side effects such as growth scars or connective tissue nodules (granulomas) are extremely rare. What is typical, however, is what is known as an initial reaction, which can show up as reddening, skin peeling, swelling and possibly slight pain. This is a phenomenon that is often observed in naturopathy and indicates the beginning of the body's cleansing and repair processes. These symptoms are fully reversible and usually short-lived.</p>

								<p>Our facial expression says a lot about us, expresses emotions, communicates with the world around us and is at the same time unique!</p>

								<p>That is why it is extremely important to us to preserve the individuality of each of our customers during cosmetic procedures. With the subcutaneous and not intramuscular injection, MesoBotox ensures a more relaxed, fresher and more natural facial expression.
								The result of MesoBotox is smooth, fresh and beautiful skin. Small wrinkles and a tired complexion disappear.

								<p>The treatment is on an outpatient basis and takes about half an hour to 1 hour. Before the start of the treatment, you will be informed in detail about the procedure, the procedure, possible risks and side effects of the treatment.</p><p>
								Instead of injecting the active ingredient botulinum into the muscle to be treated to slow it down, MesoBotox is injected into the overlying skin areas with a very fine needle (microneedle) with the help of many small punctures. This ensures a more even, smooth overall appearance of the skin.</p><p>
								Because a very fine needle is used for the injection, local anesthesia is not necessary. If desired, an anesthetic cream can be applied to the areas to be treated before the treatment. This acts for about 20 minutes before the treatment starts.</p><p>
								The desired effect occurs after about 3 - 7 days. It is recommended to repeat the treatment once or twice every two months to achieve a harmonious result.</p>

								<p>MesoBotox injections are less painful and well tolerated. The effect after a treatment occurs after 3 - 7 days. It is not recommended to take muscle relaxants, aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs at the same time.</p><p>
								The treatment is carried out once or twice and repeated about every six months.</p><p>

								What you should consider!</p><p>
								After the treatment you should avoid sports, visits to the sauna and sunbathing for the next few days.</p><p>
								Strong facial expressions and pressure on the treated areas should also be avoided for a few hours</p>
